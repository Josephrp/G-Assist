# Access Stock Tonic ‚Äì G-Assist Plugin

> **Accessibility-focused stock analysis with visual feedback through keyboard lighting**

Access Stock Tonic is a G-Assist plugin that makes market news, sentiment, and predictions instantly accessible‚Äîespecially for users with auditory or mobility challenges‚Äîby changing your keyboard's lighting in real time based on financial events and analysis. The plugin supports both audio (voice) and keyboard (text) input for maximum accessibility.

## Workflow Steps
1. **User Input**: The user provides a query (e.g., "Analyze AAPL" or "Tell me 
about Apple").
2. **Query Processing**: The system extracts the relevant stock symbol or name 
from the input.
3. **Stock Analysis**: The analysis agent performs a comprehensive analysis of 
the single stock.
4. **Output**: The result is a simple, clear analysis of the requested stock.

## Key Points
- Only single stock analysis is supported.
- No api keys required 
- No trades are placed
- The workflow is linear: input ‚Üí process ‚Üí analyze ‚Üí output.

## Keyboard Color Control (OpenRGB)

You can now control your keyboard or any OpenRGB-compatible device's color using the `set_keyboard_color` tool call. This works with any device supported by OpenRGB running on your system.

### Supported Colors
- red
- green
- blue
- yellow
- purple
- orange
- pink
- white
- black

### Example Usage
- "Change my keyboard color to blue"
- "/set_keyboard_color color=red"
- "Set my RGB devices to green"

### JSON Tool Call Example
```json
{
  "tool_calls": [{
    "func": "set_keyboard_color",
    "params": {
      "color": "blue"
    },
    "messages": [],
    "system_info": ""
  }]
}
```

### Troubleshooting
- **No color change?** Ensure OpenRGB is running and your devices are detected.
- **Unknown color error?** Only the colors listed above are supported.
- **No devices found?** Check your OpenRGB setup and device compatibility.

### Developer Notes
- The color map and tool handler are implemented in `plugin.py` using the OpenRGB Python API.
- You can extend the color map or add per-device support as needed.

## How to Use Keyboard Color Control

You can control your keyboard or any OpenRGB-compatible device's color using natural language, slash commands, or JSON tool calls. Example commands:

- "Change my keyboard color to blue"
- "Set my RGB devices to green"
- "/set_keyboard_color color=red"
- "Configure color feedback for imminent events to orange"
- "/configure_color_feedback mode=imminent color=orange"

### Supported Colors

To see all supported colors, use the tool call:

- "/list_supported_colors"

Or programmatically:
```json
{
  "tool_calls": [{
    "func": "list_supported_colors",
    "params": {}
  }]
}
```

### Configuring Color Feedback

You can assign specific colors to feedback modes (e.g., for event proximity):

- **none**: Default/idle state
- **near**: Approaching event
- **imminent**: Event is imminent

Example tool call:
```json
{
  "tool_calls": [{
    "func": "configure_color_feedback",
    "params": {
      "mode": "imminent",
      "color": "orange"
    }
  }]
}
```

### Example JSON Tool Call to Set Color
```json
{
  "tool_calls": [{
    "func": "set_keyboard_color",
    "params": {
      "color": "blue"
    }
  }]
}
```

### Troubleshooting
- **No color change?** Ensure OpenRGB is running and your devices are detected.
- **Unknown color error?** Only the colors listed above are supported. Use /list_supported_colors to see them.
- **No devices found?** Check your OpenRGB setup and device compatibility.
- **Where are logs?** All actions and errors are logged to `%USERPROFILE%\access_stock_tonic.log`.

### Developer Notes
- To add new colors, update the `COLOR_MAP` and (optionally) `COLOR_ALIASES` in `plugin.py`.
- To add new feedback modes, update the config logic in `plugin.py` and document them here.
- All color changes and configuration actions are logged for debugging and auditing.

## Persistent Automatic Keyboard Color Feedback

To ensure your keyboard color always reflects the latest event proximity‚Äî**with zero user input required**‚Äîthe plugin includes an automatic background updater:

- When you install and run the Access Stock Tonic plugin, the `auto_color_update_loop.py` script is started automatically in the background.
- This script calls the plugin's `auto_color_update` tool every 60 seconds (by default), keeping your keyboard color in sync with your calendar and feedback configuration.
- No manual action is required after installation‚Äîcolor feedback is always up to date.

### How It Works
- The script is launched as a background process when the plugin starts.
- It logs all actions and errors to `auto_color_update_loop.log` in the plugin directory.
- If you want to change the update interval, edit the script and adjust the `DEFAULT_INTERVAL` value or pass `--interval` as a command-line argument.

### Checking Status
- To verify the updater is running, check for the `auto_color_update_loop.log` file and look for recent log entries.
- You can also check running processes for `python auto_color_update_loop.py`.

### Disabling Automatic Updates
- If you wish to disable persistent color feedback, simply stop or remove the `auto_color_update_loop.py` process.
- You can also comment out or remove the script launch from the plugin's startup logic (see below).

### Developer Notes
- The plugin is designed to launch the updater script automatically for a frictionless experience.
- If you are packaging or deploying the plugin, ensure Python is available and the script is executable.

## Project Structure and Technical Overview

The Access Stock Tonic plugin is built to integrate seamlessly with the G-Assist plugin architecture. Here‚Äôs how the project is organized and how the system works under the hood:

### Directory Structure

```

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (docs, requirements, etc.)
```

### G-Assist Plugin Architecture
- **Pipe-Based Communication:**
  - The plugin communicates with G-Assist via standard input/output pipes. All commands and responses are JSON-formatted.
  - `plugin.py` sits in a loop, reading commands, dispatching them to the correct handler, and writing responses back.
- **Manifest-Driven:**
  - `manifest.json` describes the available functions, their parameters, and tags. This allows G-Assist to discover and invoke plugin capabilities.
- **Configurable:**
  - `config.json` (and optionally `.env`) stores user preferences, API keys, and color mappings.

### Command Flow
1. **User Input:**
   - The user issues a command via voice or keyboard (e.g., "get TSLA analysis").
2. **G-Assist Dispatch:**
   - G-Assist parses the command and sends a JSON request to the plugin‚Äôs input pipe.
3. **Command Handling:**
   - `plugin.py` receives the command, looks up the corresponding function (e.g., `get_analysis`), and invokes the appropriate logic.
4. **Agent/Tool Processing:**
   - The plugin leverages agents in `src/agents/` and tools in `src/tools/` to fetch data, run predictions, and analyze results.
   - For example, `src/tools/stockpredictions.py` is used for advanced market analysis.
5. **Workflow Orchestration:**
   - The workflow logic in `src/workflow/state_machine.py` manages multi-step processes, such as updating the calendar, running analyses, and bundling results.
6. **Keyboard Feedback:**
   - Based on the analysis and event timing, the plugin uses keyboard control libraries to set the color of your keyboard, providing a visual alert.
7. **Response:**
   - The plugin sends a JSON-formatted response back to G-Assist, which is then surfaced to the user (via text or audio output).

### Extensibility
- **Adding New Commands:**
  - Implement a new function in `plugin.py` and register it in the command handler and `manifest.json`.
  - Add supporting logic in `src/agents/` or `src/tools/` as needed.
- **Custom Workflows:**
  - Modify or extend the state machine in `src/workflow/state_machine.py` to support new multi-step processes.
- **Color Feedback:**
  - Update `config.json` to change color mappings or add new feedback modes.

---

## Troubleshooting Tips
- **Plugin not starting?** Check Python version and dependencies.
- **No keyboard color change?** Ensure your keyboard supports lighting control and the required drivers are installed.
- **No news events?** Double-check your ticker symbols and internet connection.
- **Missing logs?** Ensure write permissions in your user profile directory.

- All yfinance calls are mocked for reliability and speed
- To run tests:
  ```bash
  pytest plugins/access-stock-tonic/tests/test_calendar_tool.py --disable-warnings -v
  ```
- All tests must pass for a valid build

### Logging
- All activity is logged to `%USERPROFILE%\access_stock_tonic.log`
- Logs include command processing, event detection, color changes, and errors

---

### Extending Prediction Entrypoints
The prediction entrypoints are implemented in `src/tools/predictions.py` and registered in `plugin.py`. To add new prediction types or customize the analysis, extend these functions and update the command handler and manifest as needed. All entrypoints support robust error handling and parameterization for advanced use cases.

### Adding New Features
To add new features:
1. Add a new command to the `commands` dictionary in `plugin.py`
2. Implement the corresponding function with proper type hints and error handling
3. Add the function to the `functions` list in `manifest.json`:
   ```json
   {
      "name": "new_command",
      "description": "Description of what the command does",
      "tags": ["relevant", "tags"],
      "properties": {
         "parameter_name": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Description of the parameter"
         }
      }
   }
   ```
4. Manually test the function using G-Assist or by running the plugin directly
